I am a Master student at School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, under the supervision of Professor Ren Bin (https://bren.xmu.edu.cn).
I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Chemistry from Nanjing University of Technology in 2023.
My current main research interests are machine learning, spectral image denoising and superresolution.Maintain some interest in the research direction of integrating deep learning algorithms into instruments to realize dynamic data acquisition and real-time processing

Research interests
======
* Artificial intelligence technology realizes real-time denoising and super resolution of Raman spectral images
* The development of Raman spectral denoising algorithm and its supporting instrument software
